Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI Player (Minimax Algorithm)


This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React, featuring an AI player that uses the minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves. The minimax algorithm is a well-known decision-making technique often used in two-player, zero-sum games like Tic-Tac-Toe.

How the AI Works
The AI player analyzes the game board to determine the best move by simulating future moves and their outcomes. Here's how the AI implementation works:

Calculating Available Moves:

The game board's state is represented as an array.
The AI identifies available moves by iterating through the board and identifying cells that are empty.
Evaluating Moves with Minimax:

The AI calculates a score for each possible move using the minimax algorithm.
The minimax algorithm recursively explores the game tree by simulating possible moves for both players.
It assigns scores based on the outcome of the game (win, lose, or draw).
The AI aims to maximize its score while assuming the opponent aims to minimize the AI's score.
Choosing the Best Move:

After evaluating all possible moves, the AI selects the move with the highest score.
